# Magic Renamer ✏️




The **Magic Renamer** is a compact and convenient tool designed to run within Autodesk Maya. It helps you efficiently manage and rename objects in your scene with a simple, user-friendly interface. The window is designed to stay on top of your Maya session, allowing for quick access without interrupting your workflow.

## Key Features

*   **Direct Renaming:** Select one or more objects and give them all a new base name. The tool will automatically handle numbering for uniqueness.
*   **Prefixing:** Add a custom prefix to the names of all selected objects.
*   **Suffixing:** Add a custom suffix to the names of all selected objects.
*   **Search and Replace:** This powerful feature has two modes:
    *   **On Selection:** If you have objects selected, it will find and replace text only within the names of those selected objects.
    *   **Scene-Wide:** If you have *nothing* selected, it will search and replace text in the names of all objects throughout your entire scene.

This tool is perfect for cleaning up your scene hierarchy, enforcing naming conventions, and performing bulk renaming tasks quickly and easily.
